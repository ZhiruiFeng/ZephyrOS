# ZFlow Architecture Refinement Roadmap

This document tracks our systematic approach to refining ZFlow's architecture using the Feature-First Architecture pattern.

  "@/agents": ["./features/agents"],

  // Core directories
  "@/lib/*": ["./lib/*"],
  "@/hooks/*": ["./hooks/*"],
  "@/types/*": ["./types/*"],
  "@/components/*": ["./components/*"],
  "@/contexts/*": ["./contexts/*"]
}
```

#### **Import Transformation Examples**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Messy relative paths ❌
import { useAuth } from '../../contexts/AuthContext'
import { StrategyPage } from '../../features/strategy'

// AFTER: Clean path aliases ✅

#### **Phase 5.5: Shared Utilities Migration (Completed)**
**Duration**: 3 hours | **Priority**: High | **Status**: Complete

##### **Objectives**
- Eliminate duplicate functionality across features
- Create centralized shared library for cross-feature utilities
- Resolve naming conflicts in hooks and utilities
- Establish 2-layer architecture for shared vs feature-specific logic

##### **Results**
- ✅ Created comprehensive `/lib/shared/` library with 2-layer architecture
- ✅ Migrated 8 shared hooks: `useTaskOperations`, `useTaskActions`, `useActivitiesShared`, `useTimerShared`, `useAutoSave`, `useCategories`, `useCelebration`, `useModalState`
- ✅ Consolidated 4 utility modules: `task-utils`, `time-utils`, `activity-utils`, `validation-utils`
- ✅ Created 3 shared components: `StatusBadge`, `TaskCard`, `TimerDisplay`
- ✅ Established comprehensive shared type system
- ✅ Resolved all naming conflicts (e.g., `useTaskOperations` → `useFocusTaskOperations` for focus-specific version)
- ✅ Updated all features to use centralized utilities via `@/shared` imports
- ✅ Achieved zero duplication across features
- ✅ Completed optional legacy cleanup - removed all duplicate files

##### **Architecture Implemented**
**Layer 1: ZFlow Shared Library (`lib/shared/`)**
- **Path**: `@/shared/*`
- **Purpose**: ZFlow-specific utilities shared across features within the web app
- **Contains**: Hooks, utils, components, types used by multiple features

**Layer 2: Feature-Specific Extensions**
- **Purpose**: Feature-specific customizations that extend shared functionality
- **Example**: `useFocusTaskOperations` extends base `useTaskOperations`
- **Pattern**: Features import from `@/shared` and add feature-specific logic

##### **Import Guidelines Established**
```typescript
// ✅ PREFERRED: ZFlow shared utilities
import { useTaskOperations, useCategories } from '@/shared'
import { getStatusColor, formatSmartDate } from '@/shared/utils'

// ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Feature-specific extensions
import { useFocusTaskOperations } from '@/focus'

// ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Core libraries
import { tasksApi } from '@/lib/api'
import { useAuth } from '@/contexts/AuthContext'
```

##### **Files Changed**

---

### 📋 **Phase 6: Infrastructure Cleanup (Planned)**
**Duration**: Estimated 1-2 weeks | **Status**: Not Started

#### **Objectives**
- Consolidate remaining scattered hooks
- Organize shared components properly
- Clean up legacy code patterns

#### **Tasks**
- ✅ Phase 6.1 – Finalize agents feature module
- ✅ Phase 6.2 – Migrate timeline presentation layer
- [ ] Phase 6.3 – Consolidate narrative & memory domains
- [ ] Phase 6.4 – Extract profile modules into feature
- [ ] Phase 6.5 – Normalize tasks & activities workflows
- [ ] Cross-cutting cleanups (hooks, aliases, documentation)

##### ✅ **Phase 6.1 – Finalize agents feature module** (Completed)
- ✅ Move `app/components/agents/**` UI into `features/agents/components`
- ✅ Relocate `app/lib/agents/**` clients and session managers into `features/agents/api|utils`
- ✅ Expose consolidated API, hooks, and components via `features/agents/index.ts`
- ✅ Update `/app/agents/page.tsx` consumers and remove legacy imports

**Results**:
- ✅ Successfully migrated all conversation-history infrastructure from `app/lib/conversation-history` to `features/agents/utils` and `features/agents/hooks`
- ✅ Updated all component imports to use internal feature paths instead of legacy imports
- ✅ Consolidated all agents-related types under `features/agents/types/`
- ✅ AgentsPageImpl functionality fully integrated into the feature module's AgentsPage.tsx
- ✅ Removed legacy `app/lib/conversation-history/` directory
- ✅ Removed legacy `app/agents/AgentsPageImpl.tsx` file
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation and linting checks passing
- ✅ Complete feature isolation achieved - no cross-feature dependencies remain

##### ✅ **Phase 6.2 – Migrate timeline presentation layer** (Completed)
- ✅ Port `app/components/views/timeline/**` into `features/timeline/components`
- ✅ Move `app/modules/timeline/**` controllers and containers into the feature
- ✅ Align hooks with `features/timeline/hooks` and remove duplicated logic
- ✅ Update main app imports to use consolidated `@/timeline` feature
- ✅ Clean up legacy timeline modules and proxy files

**Results**:
- ✅ Successfully identified root cause of UI mess-up: main app was importing legacy TimelineHome while EventCard was migrated
- ✅ Updated `app/page.tsx` import from legacy modules to use `@/timeline` feature consolidated API
- ✅ Removed entire `app/modules/timeline/` directory containing legacy containers
- ✅ Eliminated proxy files: `app/components/views/TimelineView.tsx` and `ModernTimelineView.tsx`
- ✅ Updated `app/components/views/index.ts` to remove broken export and add explanatory comment
- ✅ Created safety backup files to ensure UI stability during transition
- ✅ All TypeScript compilation and build checks passing
- ✅ Complete timeline feature isolation achieved

**Key Lessons Learned**:
- **Mixed Dependency States**: When migrating features, ensure ALL consumers update imports simultaneously to avoid broken dependency chains
- **Import Path Analysis**: Legacy EventCard vs New EventCard were 99% identical except for import path differences (`../../../../lib/i18n` vs `@/lib/i18n`)
- **Webpack Cache Issues**: Build cache can cause phantom import errors after file deletions - clearing `.next` cache resolves these issues
- **Safety First Approach**: Creating backup files before deletion prevents UI breakage and allows for quick rollback if issues arise
- **Systematic Cleanup**: After successful migration, identify and clean all remaining legacy files in organized phases rather than ad-hoc removal

##### **Phase 6.3 – Consolidate narrative & memory domains**
- [ ] Fold `app/components/narrative/**` into `features/narrative/components`
- [ ] Relocate `hooks/memory/**` under `features/narrative/hooks` or shared `lib/memory`
- [ ] Ensure shared memory utilities are promoted to `lib/` instead of cross-feature imports

##### **Phase 6.4 – Extract profile modules into feature**
- [ ] Convert `app/components/profile/modules/**` into feature subcomponents
- [ ] Move `app/components/profile/hooks/**` into `features/profile/hooks`
- [ ] Keep `ProfilePage` as the thin controller and remove redundant exports

##### **Phase 6.5 – Normalize tasks & activities workflows**
- [ ] Consolidate `app/modules/tasks/**` and `hooks/tasks/**` into `features/focus` (or new `features/tasks`)
- [ ] Migrate `hooks/activities/**` alongside related focus components
- [ ] Create dedicated API layer for task and activity operations

##### **Cross-cutting cleanups**
- [ ] Audit remaining `hooks/**` directories and move feature-specific logic accordingly
- [ ] Deprecate `@/components/*` and `@/hooks/*` aliases once migrations complete
- [ ] Add lint guardrails to prevent regressions to legacy paths
- [ ] Refresh documentation (`ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP.md`, `CODING_RULES.md`) after each milestone

import { useFeature } from '@/feature-name'
import { apiClient } from '@/lib/api/client'
import type { FeatureType } from '@/types/domain/feature'

// ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Relative within feature
import { FeatureComponent } from './components/FeatureComponent'

// ❌ AVOID: Messy relative paths
import { useFeature } from '../../features/feature-name'
```

### **Quality Gates**
Each phase must pass:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ ESLint validation (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ Build success (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Bundle size analysis
- ✅ Feature isolation testing

### **Documentation Standards**
