# ZFlow Architecture Refinement Roadmap

This document tracks our systematic approach to refining ZFlow's architecture using the Feature-First Architecture pattern.

##### **Final Clean Architecture Implemented**
**Root-Level Shared Structure**:
```
apps/zflow/
├── hooks/                   # 🔗 All application hooks at root level
│   ├── useTaskOperations.ts    # Generic task operations
│   ├── useActivities.ts        # Activity management (renamed from useActivitiesShared)
│   ├── useTimer.ts             # Timer functionality (renamed from useTimerShared)
│   └── index.ts                # Barrel exports
├── types/shared/            # 🎯 Shared utility types
│   ├── shared-hooks.ts         # Hook return types
│   └── common.ts               # Common shared types

**Key Lessons Learned**:
- **Mixed Dependency States**: When migrating features, ensure ALL consumers update imports simultaneously to avoid broken dependency chains
- **Import Path Analysis**: Legacy EventCard vs New EventCard were 99% identical except for import path differences (`../../../../lib/i18n` vs `@/lib/i18n`)
- **Webpack Cache Issues**: Build cache can cause phantom import errors after file deletions - clearing `.next` cache resolves these issues
- **Safety First Approach**: Creating backup files before deletion prevents UI breakage and allows for quick rollback if issues arise
- **Systematic Cleanup**: After successful migration, identify and clean all remaining legacy files in organized phases rather than ad-hoc removal

- ✅ Identified and removed duplicate `useWorkModeState` hook
- ✅ Updated focus work-mode page to use feature imports (`@/focus`)
- ✅ Eliminated redundant hook definitions
- ✅ Established clean focus feature structure

##### ✅ **Phase 6.6 – Cross-cutting cleanups and import path verification** (Completed)
- ✅ Moved `app/lib/redis.ts` to `shared/utils/redis.ts` for proper organization
- ✅ Updated all Redis imports across 3 files to use `@/shared/utils/redis`

---

## 🛠 **Tools & Processes**

### **Development Workflow**
1. **Feature Analysis** - Understand current structure
2. **Structure Creation** - Follow strategy pattern
3. **Business Logic Extraction** - Move hooks and API
4. **Component Migration** - Organize UI components
5. **Public API Design** - Create clean exports
6. **Import Path Optimization** - Use path aliases (`@/feature`)
7. **Route Conversion** - Thin controller pattern
8. **Testing & Validation** - Comprehensive checks
9. **Documentation Update** - Keep roadmap current

### **Import Best Practices**
When working on features, always use the new path alias system:

```typescript
// ✅ PREFERRED: Clean path aliases
import { useFeature } from '@/feature-name'
import { apiClient } from '@/lib/api/client'
import type { FeatureType } from '@/types/domain/feature'

// ✅ ACCEPTABLE: Relative within feature
import { FeatureComponent } from './components/FeatureComponent'

// ❌ AVOID: Messy relative paths
import { useFeature } from '../../features/feature-name'
```

### **Quality Gates**
Each phase must pass:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ ESLint validation (`npm run lint`)
- ✅ Build success (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Bundle size analysis
- ✅ Feature isolation testing

### **Documentation Standards**
- Update this roadmap after each phase
- Update CODING_RULES.md with new patterns
- Document architectural decisions
- Maintain migration guides

## 🎯 **Next Actions**

With **Phase 6 Infrastructure Cleanup now complete**, we have achieved a clean, feature-first architecture. Here are the recommended next steps:

### **Immediate Priority: Phase 7 Performance Optimization**

#### **7.1 Bundle Size Analysis & Code Splitting (Recommended Next)**
- **Objective**: Implement proper code splitting for all features
- **Expected Impact**: 20-30% overall bundle size reduction
- **Tasks**:
  1. Run comprehensive bundle analysis (`npm run build && npx @next/bundle-analyzer`)
  2. Implement lazy loading for all feature routes
  3. Optimize shared component imports
  4. Add route-based code splitting
  5. Verify tree shaking is working correctly

#### **7.2 Feature Performance Optimization**
- **Objective**: Optimize individual feature performance
- **Tasks**:
  1. Add React.memo to expensive components
  2. Implement proper dependency arrays in hooks
  3. Optimize API call patterns and caching
  4. Add performance monitoring to key features

### **Alternative: Additional Feature Extraction (Optional)**

#### **Remaining Legacy Components (If Desired)**
While the core architecture is complete, there are still some legacy components that could be migrated:

1. **Narrative UI Components** (`app/components/narrative/**`)
   - Could be moved to `features/narrative/components/`
   - Low priority - current structure is functional

2. **Profile Module Components** (`app/components/profile/modules/**`)
   - Could be moved to `features/profile/components/modules/`
   - Low priority - well-organized already

3. **Task/Activity Workflows** (`app/modules/tasks/**`, `hooks/tasks/**`, `hooks/activities/**`)
   - Could be consolidated under `features/focus/` or new `features/tasks/`
   - Medium complexity - requires careful dependency analysis

### **Development Tooling & Documentation**

#### **7.3 Developer Experience Improvements**
- Create feature scaffolding CLI tool
- Add architectural lint rules to prevent regressions
- Create comprehensive feature development guide
- Set up automated bundle size monitoring

#### **7.4 Documentation Updates**
- Update CODING_RULES.md with final patterns
- Create feature migration playbook
- Document performance best practices
- Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
