## Key Integration Points

### Environment Configuration
```env
# Development
NODE_ENV=development
MCP_SERVER_PATH=./path/to/local/mcp-server

# Production
NODE_ENV=production
HTTP_MCP_URL=https://your-mcp-service.vercel.app
ZMEMORY_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

### Core Components
- **MCP Client** (`mcp-client.ts`): Environment-aware connection manager
- **HTTP Client** (`mcp-http-client.ts`): Production HTTP-based client
- **MCP Bridge** (`mcp-bridge.ts`): Tool registration and provider integration
- **Status Indicator** (`MCPStatusIndicator.tsx`): Real-time status visualization

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/agents/mcp/status`: System health and connection status
- `POST /api/agents/mcp/test`: Connection testing and validation

## Common Operations

### Development Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone and setup MCP server
git clone https://github.com/your-org/zmemory-mcp
cd zmemory-mcp && npm install

# 2. Configure environment
echo "MCP_SERVER_PATH=../zmemory-mcp/dist/index.js" >> .env.local

# 3. Start development
npm run dev
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# 1. Deploy MCP service
cd zmemory-mcp && vercel --prod

# 2. Configure production environment
# Set HTTP_MCP_URL and ZMEMORY_API_KEY in Vercel dashboard

# 3. Deploy main application
vercel --prod
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Check MCP status
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/agents/mcp/status

# Monitor logs
vercel logs --follow | grep -i mcp
```

## Support & Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **Weekly**: Review MCP connection health and tool availability
- **Monthly**: Update MCP server dependencies and tool definitions
- **Quarterly**: Performance review and optimization

### Emergency Procedures
1. **MCP Service Down**: Check **MCP_TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md** â†’ Production Issues
2. **Tool Failures**: Use diagnostic tools from troubleshooting guide
3. **Performance Issues**: Apply optimization techniques from development workflow

### Contact & Resources
