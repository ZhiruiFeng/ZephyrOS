## 📚 **Notes & Decisions**

### Technical Decisions Made:
- Using Expo for React Native development
- Supabase for authentication (consistent with web app)
- ZMemory API for backend integration
- TypeScript for type safety

### Key Considerations:
- Maintain consistency with web app UX patterns
- Reuse types and API structure from web app where possible
- Follow React Native best practices for performance
- Test thoroughly on device after each step

### Phase 1 Completion Notes:

#### Step 1.1 - Environment Configuration:
- ✅ Environment variables (.env.local) properly configured with production Supabase credentials
- ✅ Expo correctly loads and exports environment variables (verified in console output)
- ✅ Supabase client successfully initializes and connects to database
- ✅ Connection test passed - ready for authentication implementation

#### Step 1.2 - Authentication Implementation:
- ✅ Created AuthContext with Google OAuth using WebBrowser for in-app authentication
- ✅ Configured custom URL scheme (zflow://auth) in app.json
- ✅ Added Supabase redirect URL configuration (zflow://auth)
- ✅ Implemented session management with automatic state persistence
- ✅ Fixed redirect URI generation to use custom scheme instead of Expo proxy
- ✅ Complete authentication flow: login → in-app browser → Google OAuth → redirect back to iOS app

#### Step 1.3 - Navigation Integration:
- ✅ Updated AppNavigator to use real authentication state from AuthContext
- ✅ Added loading screen during authentication state check
- ✅ Proper navigation guards: unauthenticated users see login, authenticated users see main app
- ✅ Seamless transition from login to main app tabs after successful authentication

### Key Technical Solutions:
- **In-App Authentication**: Used `WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync` for seamless OAuth within the app
- **Custom URL Scheme**: Configured `zflow://auth` for proper redirect handling
- **Supabase Integration**: Added custom redirect URL to Supabase dashboard configuration
- **Token Handling**: Proper extraction of access tokens from URL fragments
