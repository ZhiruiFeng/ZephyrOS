## 🔧 Infrastructure Ready (Not Yet Migrated)

| Route | Status | Reason Deferred | Next Action |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| `/api/tasks` | Infrastructure built ✅ | Working perfectly, schema mismatch | Use infrastructure for future features |

## 🎯 Next Up (Prioritized)

### High Priority - Ready to Migrate

| Route | Lines | Complexity | Infrastructure | Risk | Estimated Time |
|-------|-------|------------|----------------|------|----------------|
| `/api/subtasks` | 368 | Medium | Can use TaskService | Medium | 3-4h |

| `/api/tasks/stats` | ~200 | Medium | Service ✅ | Low | 1-2h |
| `/api/memories/search` | 422 | High | Service ✅ | Medium | 2-3h |

### Medium Priority - Need Planning

| Route | Lines | Complexity | Infrastructure | Issue |
|-------|-------|------------|----------------|-------|
| `/api/core-principles` | 468 | Very High | None | Need to build service/repo |
| `/api/daily-strategy` | 425 | High | None | Complex business logic |

### Low Priority - Defer for Now

| Route | Lines | Reason |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `/api/relations/*` | 547+ | Complex relationship management |
| `/api/strategy/*` | 609+ | Complex strategic planning |
| `/api/narrative/*` | - | Narrative episodes/seasons |

## 🚧 Blockers & Dependencies

### Current Blockers
- None currently blocking progress

### Resolved Blockers
- ✅ TaskRepository schema mismatch (fixed 2025-10-03)
- ✅ Service layer error handling improvements needed (ongoing)
- ✅ Type safety vs runtime data (documented patterns)

### Dependencies for Future Migrations

**For `/api/memories`**:
- ✅ MemoryRepository exists
- ✅ MemoryAnalysisService exists
- ⏳ Need to verify schema alignment
- ⏳ Need to test repository independently

**For `/api/core-principles`**:
- ❌ No repository exists
- ❌ No service exists
- ⏳ Complex business logic needs analysis
- ⏳ Timeline mapping needs design

**For `/api/daily-strategy`**:
- ❌ No repository exists
- ❌ No service exists
- ⏳ Strategic planning logic needs analysis

## 📅 Session Log

### Session 1: 2025-10-03 (Tasks Infrastructure)

**Goals**: Migrate `/api/tasks` to new architecture
**Time**: ~6 hours
**Outcome**: ✅ Infrastructure built, ⏸️ Migration deferred

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created TaskService (272 lines)
- ✅ Fixed TaskRepository schema queries
- ✅ Added categoryRepository to ServiceDependencies
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (40+ test cases)
- ✅ All tests passed

**Lessons**:
- Schema verification is critical
- Don't migrate working code without clear benefit
- Infrastructure can be built even if migration deferred
- Comprehensive testing reveals migration value

**Artifacts**:
- `lib/services/task-service.ts` - Ready for future use
- `lib/database/repositories/task-repository.ts` - Fixed
- `MIGRATION_LESSONS_LEARNED.md` - Comprehensive lessons
- `MIGRATION_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` - This file

**Next Session**: Plan `/api/memories` migration

## 🎯 Goals & Milestones

### Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks)
- [ ] Migrate `/api/memories` main route
- [ ] Migrate 2-3 sub-routes (tasks/[id], memories/[id])
- [ ] Build CorePrincipleRepository + Service
- [ ] Update progress after each migration

### Medium-Term (Next Month)
- [ ] Complete Phase 3 (core feature APIs)
- [ ] Migrate `/api/core-principles`
- [ ] Migrate `/api/daily-strategy`
- [ ] Reach 20-25 routes migrated (20% complete)

### Long-Term (Next Quarter)
- [ ] Migrate all high-traffic routes
- [ ] Migrate all CRUD routes
- [ ] Defer or migrate complex routes based on business need
- [ ] Reach 50% migration complete

## 📝 Quick Commands

```bash
# Count migrated routes
grep "✅" MIGRATION_STATUS.md | wc -l

# Check remaining routes
find app/api -name "route.ts" | wc -l

# See files changed in last session
git log --oneline --name-only -5

# Type-check entire project
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run dev server
npm run dev
```

## 🔄 Update Checklist (After Each Migration)

When completing a migration, update:

- [ ] This file (MIGRATION_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md)
  - [ ] Add to completed migrations table
  - [ ] Update metrics
  - [ ] Add session log entry
  - [ ] Update visual progress bar
- [ ] MIGRATION_STATUS.md
  - [ ] Move route from "Upcoming" to "Completed"
  - [ ] Add migration comparison notes
- [ ] MIGRATION_LESSONS_LEARNED.md (if new lessons)
  - [ ] Add any new patterns discovered
  - [ ] Document any issues encountered
- [ ] MIGRATION_COMPARISON.md (for major routes)
  - [ ] Add before/after code comparison

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start small**: Migrate simple routes first to build confidence
2. **Verify schema**: Always check actual database columns before building repository
3. **Test independently**: Test repository and service before using in routes
4. **Document immediately**: Update docs right after migration while fresh
5. **Don't over-engineer**: Service layer should add value, not complexity
6. **Defer when appropriate**: Working code doesn't need migration just for architecture
