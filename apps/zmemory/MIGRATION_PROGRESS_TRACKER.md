- ✅ MemoryAnalysisService exists (`lib/services/memory-analysis-service.ts`)
- ✅ Schema aligned and tested

**`/api/core-principles`**: ✅ **MIGRATED & COMPLETE**
- ✅ Route migrated with `withStandardMiddleware` (312 → 48 lines, 85% reduction)
- ✅ CorePrincipleRepository exists (`lib/database/repositories/core-principle-repository.ts`)
- ✅ CorePrincipleService exists (`lib/services/core-principle-service.ts`)
- ✅ Full CRUD operations with advanced filtering
- ✅ Integrated into dependency injection system

**`/api/daily-strategy`**: ✅ **MIGRATED & COMPLETE**
- ✅ Route migrated with `withStandardMiddleware` (357 → 54 lines, 85% reduction)
- ✅ DailyStrategyRepository exists (`lib/database/repositories/daily-strategy-repository.ts`)

- ✅ Integrated into dependency injection system

**Note**: All three core routes (`/api/memories`, `/api/core-principles`, `/api/daily-strategy`) now have complete service/repository layers with proper separation of concerns.

## 📅 Session Log

### Session 1: 2025-10-03 (Tasks Infrastructure)

**Goals**: Migrate `/api/tasks` to new architecture
**Time**: ~6 hours
**Outcome**: ✅ Infrastructure built, ⏸️ Migration deferred

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created TaskService (272 lines)
- ✅ Fixed TaskRepository schema queries
- ✅ Added categoryRepository to ServiceDependencies
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (40+ test cases)
- ✅ All tests passed

**Lessons**:
- Schema verification is critical
- Don't migrate working code without clear benefit
- Infrastructure can be built even if migration deferred
- Comprehensive testing reveals migration value

**Artifacts**:
- `lib/services/task-service.ts` - Ready for future use
- `lib/database/repositories/task-repository.ts` - Fixed
- `MIGRATION_LESSONS_LEARNED.md` - Comprehensive lessons
- `MIGRATION_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md` - This file

**Next Session**: Plan `/api/memories` migration

### Session 2: 2025-10-03 (Service Layer Migration)

**Goals**: Add service/repository layers to `/api/core-principles` and `/api/daily-strategy`
**Time**: ~2.5 hours
**Outcome**: ✅ Both routes successfully migrated with full service layers

**Completed**:
- ✅ Created CorePrincipleRepository (261 lines)
- ✅ Created CorePrincipleService (284 lines)
- ✅ Refactored `/api/core-principles` route (312 → 48 lines, 85% reduction)
- ✅ Created DailyStrategyRepository (331 lines)
- ✅ Created DailyStrategyService (354 lines)
- ✅ Refactored `/api/daily-strategy` route (357 → 54 lines, 85% reduction)
- ✅ Updated all service factory functions with new repositories
- ✅ All builds passing

**Lessons**:
- Service/repository pattern provides massive code reduction (85% in both cases)
- Proper type safety requires careful handling of Supabase query results
- RPC functions can be wrapped in repository methods for cleaner service code
- Timeline item verification across multiple repositories needs error handling
- Dependency injection makes testing and maintenance much easier

**Artifacts**:
- `lib/database/repositories/core-principle-repository.ts` - Full CRUD with filtering
- `lib/services/core-principle-service.ts` - Business logic layer
- `lib/database/repositories/daily-strategy-repository.ts` - Complex joins + RPC
- `lib/services/daily-strategy-service.ts` - Timeline verification logic
- Updated all service dependencies to include new repositories

**Impact**:
- 669 lines of route code reduced to 102 lines
- Clean separation of concerns (routes → services → repositories)
- Consistent error handling and validation patterns
- Both routes now match architectural standards

## 🔄 Update Checklist (After Each Migration)

When completing a migration, update:

- [ ] This file (MIGRATION_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md)
  - [ ] Add to completed migrations table
  - [ ] Update metrics
  - [ ] Add session log entry
  - [ ] Update visual progress bar
- [ ] MIGRATION_STATUS.md
  - [ ] Move route from "Upcoming" to "Completed"
  - [ ] Add migration comparison notes
- [ ] MIGRATION_LESSONS_LEARNED.md (if new lessons)
  - [ ] Add any new patterns discovered
  - [ ] Document any issues encountered
- [ ] MIGRATION_COMPARISON.md (for major routes)
  - [ ] Add before/after code comparison

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start small**: Migrate simple routes first to build confidence
2. **Verify schema**: Always check actual database columns before building repository
3. **Test independently**: Test repository and service before using in routes
4. **Document immediately**: Update docs right after migration while fresh
5. **Don't over-engineer**: Service layer should add value, not complexity
6. **Defer when appropriate**: Working code doesn't need migration just for architecture
