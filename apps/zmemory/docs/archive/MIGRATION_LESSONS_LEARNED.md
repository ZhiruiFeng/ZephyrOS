# Migration Lessons Learned

This document captures critical lessons, patterns, and gotchas discovered during the ZMemory API migration to the new architecture.

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-03
**Migrations Completed**: 89 routes
**Deferred**: 1 route (tasks - infrastructure built)
**Note**: Lessons now integrated into DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md

## üéØ Quick Reference - Before Starting Any Migration

### Pre-Migration Checklist
- [ ] **Verify database schema** matches TypeScript types (use Supabase Studio or `\d tablename` in psql)
- [ ] Check if Repository exists and is correct
- [ ] Check if Service exists and what methods it provides
- [ ] Read the original route completely to understand all features
- [ ] List all filtering, sorting, pagination features that must be preserved
- [ ] Identify any special business logic (category lookup, hierarchy, auto-completion, etc.)
- [ ] Create backup of original route file
- [ ] Plan testing approach before writing code

### Critical Questions to Ask
1. **Is the route working perfectly?** ‚Üí If yes, consider deferring migration
2. **Does the database schema match the TypeScript interface?** ‚Üí Verify before building repository
3. **What's the actual business value of migrating this route?** ‚Üí Don't migrate for architecture sake alone
4. **Are there existing routes similar to this?** ‚Üí Reuse patterns from successful migrations

## üìö Key Lessons by Topic

### 1. Database Schema vs TypeScript Types ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Lesson**: TypeScript interfaces do NOT always match actual database schema.

**Example 1 - Tasks Table**:
```typescript
// TypeScript Interface (WRONG for our DB)
interface Task {
  content: {
    title: string;
    status: string;
    priority: string;
  };
}

// Actual Database Schema (CORRECT)
// Flat columns: title, status, priority (no nested content object)
```

**What Happened**:
- TaskRepository was querying `content->>title` (JSON path)
- Database has flat column `title`
- Result: Queries failed silently or returned nothing

**Example 2 - Memories Table**:
```typescript
// TypeScript Interface (WRONG - includes non-existent fields)
interface Memory {
  title: string;
  note: string;
  importance_level: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'; // ‚ùå Does not exist
  mood?: number;                                 // ‚ùå Does not exist
  source?: string;                               // ‚ùå Does not exist
  context?: string;                              // ‚ùå Does not exist
  related_to: string[];                          // ‚ùå Does not exist
}

// Actual Database Schema (CORRECT)
// Has: title, note, emotion_valence, place_name, tags, etc.
// Does NOT have: importance_level, mood, source, context, related_to
```

**What Happened**:
- MemoryService tried to insert `importance_level` field
- Database error: "Could not find the 'importance_level' column"
- Had to remove 5 non-existent fields from all operations

**Prevention**:
1. Check Supabase Studio to see actual columns
2. Use `SELECT * FROM table LIMIT 1` to see real structure
3. Compare original route's insert payload with TypeScript interface
4. Update TypeScript types to match database, or vice versa
5. Test repository queries independently before using in routes
6. Document non-existent fields clearly in interface comments

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Audit all existing Repository classes for schema mismatches
- [ ] Create script to generate TypeScript types from actual database schema
- [ ] Add schema validation tests

---

### 2. Repository Pattern - When to Use What

**Lesson**: Not all repositories implement custom filtering correctly.

**BaseRepository.findByUser()**:
- Uses generic `applyFilters()` method
- Only handles: status, tags, dates, category_id
- **Does NOT handle**: task-specific fields like `root_tasks_only`, `hierarchy_level`, `priority`

**TaskRepository.findTasksAdvanced()**:
- Uses custom `applyTaskFilters()` method
- Handles ALL task-specific filters
- **Always use this for tasks**, not the base method

**Pattern Discovered**:
```typescript
// ‚ùå WRONG - Misses task-specific filters
const result = await taskRepository.findByUser(userId, filters);

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Handles all filters
const result = await taskRepository.findTasksAdvanced(userId, filters);
```

**Rule**: Always check if the repository has a specialized method for your use case.

---

### 3. Service Layer - Adding Value vs Adding Complexity

**Lesson**: Service layer should provide clear business value, not just wrap repository calls.

**Good Use Cases for Service Layer**:
- ‚úÖ Cross-repository operations (e.g., creating task + linking to memory)
- ‚úÖ Complex business logic (e.g., category name ‚Üí ID lookup)
- ‚úÖ Workflow validation (e.g., status transition rules)
- ‚úÖ Batch operations with transaction handling
- ‚úÖ Analytics/aggregations across multiple tables

**Bad Use Cases**:
- ‚ùå Simple CRUD that just calls repository (no value added)
- ‚ùå Direct passthrough of filters (repository can do this)
- ‚ùå When original route is simple and working perfectly

**Tasks Example**:
- Original route: 611 lines, works perfectly, all features functional
- Service layer: Adds type complexity, schema mismatch issues
- **Decision**: Keep original route, use service for future enhancements only

**Rule**: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" - migrate routes that need changes, not working routes.

---

### 4. Error Handling - Be Specific

**Lesson**: Generic error messages hide the real problem.

**What Happened**:
```typescript
// Base service wraps errors generically
throw new ServiceError("List operation failed");
// Real error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'title')"
```

**Better Approach**:
```typescript
// Log the actual error before wrapping
console.error('[TaskService] Query failed:', actualError);
throw new ServiceError("List operation failed", { cause: actualError });
```

**Rule**: Always log underlying errors before wrapping them. Include context (userId, filters, etc.).

---

### 5. Type Safety vs Runtime Reality

**Lesson**: TypeScript types are compile-time only; runtime data can differ.

**Example**:
```typescript
// TypeScript says Task has 'content' object
const task: Task = result.data;
console.log(task.content.title); // ‚ùå Runtime error!

// Runtime data is flat
console.log(task.title); // ‚úÖ Works
```

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Map database row to expected interface
const mapped = (row: any) => ({
  id: row.id,
  content: {
    title: row.title,  // Flat DB ‚Üí Nested interface
    status: row.status,
    priority: row.priority,
  }
});
```

**Rule**: Always verify runtime data structure matches TypeScript types.

---

### 6. Testing Strategy

**Lesson**: Test infrastructure independently before using in routes.

**Best Practice**:
1. **Unit test repository** with real database queries
2. **Unit test service** with mocked repository
3. **Integration test route** with real service
4. **Manual test** with comprehensive checklist

**Tasks Testing Success**:
- 40+ test cases documented
- All filtering, sorting, pagination tested
- Edge cases covered (empty results, special characters, rate limiting)
- **Result**: High confidence in original route stability

**Rule**: Comprehensive testing reveals whether migration is worth the risk.

---

### 7. Migration Decision Framework

**Lesson**: Not every route should be migrated immediately.

**Migrate NOW if**:
- ‚úÖ Route has bugs or needs new features
- ‚úÖ Code is hard to maintain/understand
- ‚úÖ Business logic should be reusable
- ‚úÖ Route is simple and migration is low-risk
- ‚úÖ Existing infrastructure (service/repository) is proven

**Defer Migration if**:
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Route works perfectly with all features
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Migration adds complexity without clear benefit
- ‚è∏Ô∏è Schema mismatches need to be resolved first
- ‚è∏Ô∏è High risk of regression for low reward
- ‚è∏Ô∏è No clear business driver for change

**Tasks Decision**:
- Working perfectly: ‚úÖ
- All features functional: ‚úÖ
- High complexity: ‚úÖ
- Schema mismatch issues: ‚úÖ
- **Decision**: Defer migration, use infrastructure for future features

## üèÜ Successful Migration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple CRUD (Categories, Task Relations)
**Characteristics**:
- Single table operations
- Standard CRUD only
- No complex joins or aggregations

**Recipe**:
1. Create Repository (extend BaseRepository)
2. Create Service with CRUD methods
3. Create validation schemas
4. Simple route handlers (50-80 lines)
5. **Time**: 2-3 hours

**Success Rate**: 100% (all Phase 1 & 2 routes)

---

### Pattern 2: Multi-Route Feature (Conversations, Activities)
**Characteristics**:
- Multiple route files for one feature
- Shared repository/service
- CRUD + specialized operations (search, stats)

**Recipe**:
1. Create comprehensive Repository
2. Create Service with all operations
3. Multiple thin route files
4. Reuse service across routes
5. **Time**: 3-4 hours

**Success Rate**: 100% (conversations, activities)

---

### Pattern 3: Lookup/Read-Only (Vendors, Interaction Types, Energy Days)
**Characteristics**:
- Read-mostly or read-only
- Simple filtering
- System data (not user-created)

**Recipe**:
1. Service-only pattern (no custom repository)
2. Use base repository or direct queries
3. Very thin routes (30-50 lines)
4. **Time**: 1-2 hours

**Success Rate**: 100% (all lookup routes)

---

## ‚ùå Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Migrating for Architecture Sake
**Symptom**: "Let's migrate because the new pattern is better"
**Problem**: Working code gets broken for minimal gain
**Solution**: Only migrate routes that need changes or clear improvements

### Anti-Pattern 2: Trusting TypeScript Types
**Symptom**: "The type says it has 'content' so I'll use it"
**Problem**: Runtime data doesn't match types
**Solution**: Verify actual data structure from database

### Anti-Pattern 3: Generic Error Handling
**Symptom**: "List operation failed" with no context
**Problem**: Can't debug or fix issues
**Solution**: Log specific errors with context

### Anti-Pattern 4: Skipping Schema Verification
**Symptom**: "I'll just build the repository based on the interface"
**Problem**: Repository queries wrong columns
**Solution**: Always check actual database schema first

### Anti-Pattern 5: Over-Engineering Simple Routes
**Symptom**: Creating service layer for simple passthrough
**Problem**: Added complexity with no value
**Solution**: Use service when there's real business logic

## üìù Recent Migration: Memories Route (2025-10-03)

### Route: /api/memories

**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Time Spent**: ~2 hours
**Lines**: 507 ‚Üí 82 (84% reduction)

### Pre-Migration Checklist
- ‚úÖ Database schema verified (found 5 non-existent fields)
- ‚úÖ MemoryRepository exists with flat schema
- ‚úÖ MemoryAnalysisService exists
- ‚úÖ All features identified (20+ filters, search, location, emotions)

### Schema Mismatch Discovered
**Fields in TypeScript interface that DO NOT exist in database:**
- `importance_level` (most critical - caused initial error)
- `mood`
- `source`
- `context`
- `related_to`

### Changes Made
**MemoryRepository (lib/database/repositories/memory-repository.ts)**:
- Updated Memory interface with comments documenting non-existent fields
- Removed `importance_level`, `min_mood`, `related_to` from MemoryFilterParams
- Removed 'context' from search_fields type (only 'note', 'place_name', 'all')
- Fixed applyMemoryFilters to skip non-existent columns
- Fixed searchMemoriesWithRelevance to not search context field
- Fixed getMemoryStatistics to not count by_importance

**MemoryService (lib/services/memory-service.ts)**:
- Created complete CRUD service (268 lines)
- Explicitly whitelisted only fields that exist in database
- Removed importance_level from all filter operations
- Updated MemoryQueryParams to exclude non-existent fields

**Route (app/api/memories/route.ts)**:
- 507 lines ‚Üí 82 lines (84% reduction)
- Uses withStandardMiddleware pattern
- Rate limiting: 300 GET / 100 POST per 15min
- All 20+ filters preserved and working

### Issues Encountered

**Issue 1: Database Error on POST**
```
Database error: "Could not find the 'importance_level' column of 'memories' in the schema cache"
```
**Solution**:
- Checked original route's insert payload (line 478 comment explicitly lists non-existent fields)
- Removed all 5 non-existent fields from MemoryService.createMemory()
- Updated filters to exclude importance_level

### Testing Results
- ‚úÖ GET /api/memories - all filters working
- ‚úÖ POST /api/memories - create working
- ‚úÖ Search functionality working
- ‚úÖ Location filters working
- ‚úÖ Emotion filters working
- ‚úÖ All features preserved

### Lessons Learned

**Schema Verification is CRITICAL**:
- This is the 2nd time (after tasks) that TypeScript interfaces didn't match database
- Always check original route's insert payload for field exclusions
- Look for comments like "Note: X, Y, Z are NOT included as they don't exist"
- MemoryRepository interface had 5 phantom fields that would have broken operations

**Pattern for Handling Schema Mismatches**:
1. Keep TypeScript interface with all fields (for compatibility)
2. Document clearly which fields don't exist (comments in interface)
3. Explicitly whitelist fields in create/update operations
4. Exclude phantom fields from filter parameters
5. Test immediately after implementation

**Pre-Migration Analysis Saved Time**:
- Reading original route's payload revealed non-existent fields
- Caught schema issues before first test
- Applied lessons from tasks migration immediately

### Decision
‚úÖ **Migration Complete** - All tests passed, 84% code reduction achieved

### Artifacts
- Backup: `app/api/memories/route.ts.backup`
- Current: `app/api/memories/route.ts` (migrated)
- Service: `lib/services/memory-service.ts` (new)
- Repository: `lib/database/repositories/memory-repository.ts` (updated with schema docs)

## üöÄ Next Migration Recommendations

Based on lessons learned:

### Recommended Order

1. **`/api/memories` (NEXT)** - Similar to tasks but simpler, infrastructure exists
2. **Sub-routes** - `/api/tasks/[id]`, `/api/memories/[id]` - Lower risk, quick wins
3. **`/api/core-principles`** - Large complex route, defer until more experience
4. **`/api/daily-strategy`** - Complex business logic, needs careful planning

### Before Starting Memories

- [ ] Verify MemoryRepository queries flat columns not JSON paths
- [ ] Test MemoryRepository.findMemoriesAdvanced() independently
- [ ] Check database schema for memories table
- [ ] List all features to preserve (search, anchors, assets, etc.)
- [ ] Review activities migration for similar patterns
