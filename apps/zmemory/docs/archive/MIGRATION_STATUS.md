Highlights:
- All migrated routes now rely on the standard middleware pipeline (auth, validation, CORS, rate limiting, error handling).
- AI task migration established the repository/service pattern including cost analytics, batching, and metadata normalisation.
- Categories migration demonstrates clean CRUD pattern with usage validation (prevents deletion of in-use categories).
- Task Relations migration shows complex validation logic (task existence checks, duplicate prevention) cleanly separated into service layer.
- Conversations migration shows multi-route refactor (5 route files → repository + service pattern), comprehensive session + message management with search and stats.
- Activities migration demonstrates Phase 3 readiness (4 route files, 950 lines → service + analytics pattern), complex time-entry operations with timer logic, leverages existing ActivityRepository.
- Memories migration reinforces schema verification lesson (5 non-existent fields discovered), achieved 84% code reduction (507→82 lines), comprehensive filtering with 20+ parameters.
- Sub-route pattern established: 5 sub-routes migrated achieving 2-78% reduction by leveraging existing services, averaging 0.3-0.5h per route (total time decreasing as patterns solidify).
- Lookup endpoints (vendors, interaction-types, energy-days) demonstrate service-only pattern (no repository needed for read-mostly system data).
- Types were modularised into `/lib/database/types/**` and `/lib/services/types/**`, keeping legacy imports working via index re-exports.
- **Null-safety lesson learned**: TypeScript requires `supabaseServer!` (non-null assertion) when using in variable assignments and query builders, even when already verified non-null in middleware. Applied consistently across all routes.
- **Final batch (87-89) completed**: All 3 remaining routes migrated successfully (strategy/memories, relations/brokerage, strategy/tasks) with 104 lines removed (6.4% reduction). Build passed on first try! Only 1 route deferred (`/api/tasks`).

## 🚧 Active & Upcoming Targets

| API Route | Current Blockers / Notes | Planned Actions |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| `/api/tasks` | 602 lines - **DEFERRED** | Complex route with high-risk - postponed to later phase |
| **PHASE 3 COMPLETE** | 89/90 routes migrated (98.9%) | Only `/api/tasks` deferred |

**Next Phase:**
- Evaluate `/api/tasks` migration approach (high-risk due to complexity)
- Consider phased migration or rewrite strategy
- Review all migrated routes for optimization opportunities

For detailed sequencing see `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (Phase 2 & 3 sections).

---

## 🧭 TODO Checklist (Next Sessions)

### High Priority
- [x] `/api/categories`: stand up repository/service + middleware, capture deltas in `MIGRATION_COMPARISON.md`.
- [x] `/api/task-relations`: migrate and document relationship-specific lessons learned.
- [x] Update this dashboard after each route to keep status current.

### Medium Priority
- [x] `/api/conversations`: CRUD migration with multi-route refactor (5 routes).
- [x] `/api/activities`: CRUD + analytics migration (4 routes, first Phase 3 route).
- [x] Batch-migrate lightweight lookup endpoints (`/api/vendors`, `/api/interaction-types`, `/api/energy-days`).
- [ ] `/api/core-principles`: Extract complex business logic to service layer (1,785 lines across 4 routes - very large).
- [ ] Capture a reusable smoke-test checklist in this file once Phase 2 routes land.

### Long-Term (Phase 3 Prep)
- [x] `/api/tasks`: Infrastructure work completed (TaskService, TaskRepository fixes). Migration deferred - see notes.
- [ ] Audit repository readiness for memories; fill gaps before starting Phase 3.
- [ ] Establish automated regression baselines (snapshot or contract tests) ahead of large migrations.

## 📝 Tasks Route - Infrastructure Work & Lessons Learned

### Work Completed (2025-10-03)
**Files Modified:**
- ✅ Created `lib/services/task-service.ts` (272 lines) - CRUD operations service
- ✅ Fixed `lib/database/repositories/task-repository.ts` - Updated `applyTaskFilters` to use flat column queries instead of JSON paths
- ✅ Added `categoryRepository` to `ServiceDependencies` type
- ✅ Updated service exports in `lib/services/index.ts`

**Infrastructure Benefits:**
- TaskService provides clean CRUD interface with category lookup
- TaskRepository now correctly queries flat database schema (not JSON content)
- Service layer ready for future use (workflows, batch operations, etc.)
- All filtering works: root_tasks_only, status, priority, hierarchy, search, pagination, sorting

### Key Discoveries
1. **Schema Mismatch**: The `Task` TypeScript interface defines a nested `content` object, but the actual database has flat columns (title, status, priority, etc.)
2. **Repository Pattern**: TaskRepository was incorrectly using JSON path queries (`content->>field`) instead of flat column names
3. **Service vs Route**: Original route works perfectly with direct Supabase queries; service layer adds complexity without clear benefit for this route
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive manual testing (40+ test cases) all passed with original route implementation

### Decision: Migration Deferred
**Reason**: Original route (611 lines) is working perfectly with all features:
- ✅ All filtering works (root_tasks_only, status, priority, search, hierarchy, etc.)
- ✅ Sorting and pagination work correctly
- ✅ Category lookup functional
- ✅ Subtasks and hierarchy fully supported
- ✅ Performance is good
- ✅ Zero bugs reported

**Risk/Benefit Analysis**:
- **Migration Benefits**: Slightly cleaner code (611 → ~270 lines), automatic middleware
- **Migration Risks**: Type mismatches, complex hierarchy logic, potential regressions
- **Conclusion**: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" - defer migration until clear business need

### Recommendations for Future Migrations
1. **Verify schema first**: Check actual database columns vs TypeScript types before building repository
2. **Start simple**: Migrate simpler routes first to establish patterns
3. **Test infrastructure**: Ensure repository/service work independently before route migration
4. **Keep working code**: Don't migrate for the sake of migrating; focus on routes that need changes

### Artifacts Preserved
- Backup: `app/api/tasks/route.ts.backup` (original working version)
- Current: `app/api/tasks/route.ts` (restored original after testing)
- Service: `lib/services/task-service.ts` (ready for future use)
- Repository: `lib/database/repositories/task-repository.ts` (fixed, ready for future use)
