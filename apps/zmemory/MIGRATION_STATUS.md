# üîÑ ZMemory API Migration Status Dashboard

Single source of truth for the ZMemory API refactor. Contains current phase
progress, completed work, upcoming tasks, architecture patterns, and quick
startup instructions for future migration sessions.

---

## üìä Phase Snapshot

| Phase | Focus | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| Phase 0 | Project scaffolding & safety rails | ‚úÖ Complete | Path aliases, documentation baseline, zero-breaking-change guardrails |
| Phase 1 | Quick-win routes & pattern validation | ‚úÖ Complete | `/api/health`, `/api/docs`, `/api/agent-features`, `/api/ai-tasks` |
| Phase 2 | High-impact support APIs | üîÑ In progress | Next targets: `/api/categories`, `/api/task-relations`, auxiliary lookups |
| Phase 3 | Core feature APIs | ‚è≥ Pending | Large surfaces (tasks, memories, activities) to migrate incrementally |

> Detailed before/after comparisons continue to live in
> `MIGRATION_COMPARISON.md`. Use this dashboard for actionable next steps.

## ‚úÖ Completed Route Migrations

| API Route | Status | Key Improvements |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| `/api/health` | ‚úÖ | Converted to middleware stack, added 60/min rate limit, simplified handler |
| `/api/docs` | ‚úÖ | Public middleware with unified CORS + logging, removed bespoke response handling |
| `/api/agent-features` | ‚úÖ | Added auth + validation middleware, service layer, OPTIONS preflight |
| `/api/ai-tasks` | ‚úÖ | Full repository/service refactor, metadata-driven schema alignment, service-role Supabase client |
| `/api/categories` | ‚úÖ | CategoryRepository + CategoryService with CRUD operations, rate limiting (300 GET, 50 POST, 100 PUT, 50 DELETE per 15min) |
| `/api/task-relations` | ‚úÖ | TaskRelationRepository + TaskRelationService with relationship management, task existence validation, duplicate prevention |
| `/api/vendors` | ‚úÖ | VendorService with vendor/service lookup, optional relationship joins |
| `/api/interaction-types` | ‚úÖ | InteractionTypeService with category filtering and grouping |
| `/api/energy-days` | ‚úÖ | EnergyDayService with date-range queries and upsert logic |
| `/api/conversations` | ‚úÖ | ConversationRepository + ConversationService with session/message management, 5 routes migrated (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE list/detail/messages/search/stats), rate limiting (300 GET, 100 POST, 50 DELETE per 15min) |

Highlights:
- All migrated routes now rely on the standard middleware pipeline (auth, validation, CORS, rate limiting, error handling).
- AI task migration established the repository/service pattern including cost analytics, batching, and metadata normalisation.
- Categories migration demonstrates clean CRUD pattern with usage validation (prevents deletion of in-use categories).
- Task Relations migration shows complex validation logic (task existence checks, duplicate prevention) cleanly separated into service layer.
- Conversations migration shows multi-route refactor (5 route files ‚Üí repository + service pattern), comprehensive session + message management with search and stats.
- Lookup endpoints (vendors, interaction-types, energy-days) demonstrate service-only pattern (no repository needed for read-mostly system data).
- Types were modularised into `/lib/database/types/**` and `/lib/services/types/**`, keeping legacy imports working via index re-exports.

## üöß Active & Upcoming Targets

| API Route | Current Blockers / Notes | Planned Actions |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| `/api/core-principles` | 466 lines, complex business logic | Extract to service layer, may need custom repository methods |
| `/api/daily-strategy` | 424 lines, complex operations | Plan incremental migration approach |
| `/api/tasks` / `/api/memories` / `/api/activities` | 400‚Äì600 line legacy handlers | Break into sub-operations, plan staged rollout with regression coverage |

For detailed sequencing see `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (Phase 2 & 3 sections).

## üß≠ TODO Checklist (Next Sessions)

### High Priority
- [x] `/api/categories`: stand up repository/service + middleware, capture deltas in `MIGRATION_COMPARISON.md`.
- [x] `/api/task-relations`: migrate and document relationship-specific lessons learned.
- [x] Update this dashboard after each route to keep status current.

### Medium Priority
- [x] `/api/conversations`: CRUD migration with multi-route refactor (5 routes).
- [x] Batch-migrate lightweight lookup endpoints (`/api/vendors`, `/api/interaction-types`, `/api/energy-days`).
- [ ] `/api/core-principles`: Extract complex business logic to service layer.
- [ ] Capture a reusable smoke-test checklist in this file once Phase 2 routes land.

### Long-Term (Phase 3 Prep)
- [ ] Break `/api/tasks` migration into milestone-friendly chunks (list, detail, mutations, analytics).
- [ ] Audit repository readiness for memories/activities; fill gaps before starting Phase 3.
- [ ] Establish automated regression baselines (snapshot or contract tests) ahead of large migrations.
