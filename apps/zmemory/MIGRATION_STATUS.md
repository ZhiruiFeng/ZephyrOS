# üîÑ ZMemory API Migration Status Dashboard

Single source of truth for the ZMemory API refactor. Contains current phase
progress, completed work, upcoming tasks, architecture patterns, and quick
startup instructions for future migration sessions.

## üìä Phase Snapshot

| Phase | Focus | Status | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-------|
| Phase 0 | Project scaffolding & safety rails | ‚úÖ Complete | Path aliases, documentation baseline, zero-breaking-change guardrails |
| Phase 1 | Quick-win routes & pattern validation | ‚úÖ Complete | `/api/health`, `/api/docs`, `/api/agent-features`, `/api/ai-tasks` |
| Phase 2 | High-impact support APIs | üîÑ In progress | Next targets: `/api/categories`, `/api/task-relations`, auxiliary lookups |
| Phase 3 | Core feature APIs | ‚è≥ Pending | Large surfaces (tasks, memories, activities) to migrate incrementally |

> Detailed before/after comparisons continue to live in
> `MIGRATION_COMPARISON.md`. Use this dashboard for actionable next steps.

## ‚úÖ Completed Route Migrations

| API Route | Status | Key Improvements |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| `/api/health` | ‚úÖ | Converted to middleware stack, added 60/min rate limit, simplified handler |
| `/api/docs` | ‚úÖ | Public middleware with unified CORS + logging, removed bespoke response handling |
| `/api/agent-features` | ‚úÖ | Added auth + validation middleware, service layer, OPTIONS preflight |
| `/api/ai-tasks` | ‚úÖ | Full repository/service refactor, metadata-driven schema alignment, service-role Supabase client |

Highlights:
- All migrated routes now rely on the standard middleware pipeline (auth, validation, CORS, rate limiting, error handling).
- AI task migration established the repository/service pattern including cost analytics, batching, and metadata normalisation.
- Types were modularised into `/lib/database/types/**` and `/lib/services/types/**`, keeping legacy imports working via index re-exports.

## üöß Active & Upcoming Targets

| API Route | Current Blockers / Notes | Planned Actions |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| `/api/categories` | Legacy CRUD with inline Supabase calls | Introduce CategoryRepository + CategoryService, wrap with middleware, document delta |
| `/api/task-relations` | Mixed business logic + DB joins | Extract relationship logic to service, ensure validation + rate limits match legacy |
| `/api/vendors` / `/api/interaction-types` / `/api/energy-days` | Lightweight public endpoints | Batch migrate using `withPublicMiddleware`, add request validation where missing |
| `/api/tasks` / `/api/memories` / `/api/activities` | 400‚Äì600 line legacy handlers | Break into sub-operations, plan staged rollout with regression coverage |

For detailed sequencing see `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (Phase 2 & 3 sections).

## üß≠ TODO Checklist (Next Sessions)

### High Priority
- [ ] `/api/categories`: stand up repository/service + middleware, capture deltas in `MIGRATION_COMPARISON.md`.
- [ ] `/api/task-relations`: migrate and document relationship-specific lessons learned.
- [ ] Update this dashboard after each route to keep status current.

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Ensure every Phase 2 route has an explicit validation schema (audit and add where missing).
- [ ] Batch-migrate lightweight lookup endpoints (`/api/vendors`, `/api/interaction-types`, `/api/energy-days`).
- [ ] Capture a reusable smoke-test checklist in this file once Phase 2 routes land.

### Long-Term (Phase 3 Prep)
- [ ] Break `/api/tasks` migration into milestone-friendly chunks (list, detail, mutations, analytics).
- [ ] Audit repository readiness for memories/activities; fill gaps before starting Phase 3.
- [ ] Establish automated regression baselines (snapshot or contract tests) ahead of large migrations.
