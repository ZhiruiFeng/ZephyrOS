## ‚úÖ Completed Route Migrations

| API Route | Status | Key Improvements |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| `/api/health` | ‚úÖ | Converted to middleware stack, added 60/min rate limit, simplified handler |
| `/api/docs` | ‚úÖ | Public middleware with unified CORS + logging, removed bespoke response handling |
| `/api/agent-features` | ‚úÖ | Added auth + validation middleware, service layer, OPTIONS preflight |
| `/api/ai-tasks` | ‚úÖ | Full repository/service refactor, metadata-driven schema alignment, service-role Supabase client |
| `/api/categories` | ‚úÖ | CategoryRepository + CategoryService with CRUD operations, rate limiting (300 GET, 50 POST, 100 PUT, 50 DELETE per 15min) |
| `/api/task-relations` | ‚úÖ | TaskRelationRepository + TaskRelationService with relationship management, task existence validation, duplicate prevention |
| `/api/vendors` | ‚úÖ | VendorService with vendor/service lookup, optional relationship joins |
| `/api/interaction-types` | ‚úÖ | InteractionTypeService with category filtering and grouping |
| `/api/energy-days` | ‚úÖ | EnergyDayService with date-range queries and upsert logic |
| `/api/conversations` | ‚úÖ | ConversationRepository + ConversationService with session/message management, 5 routes migrated (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE list/detail/messages/search/stats), rate limiting (300 GET, 100 POST, 50 DELETE per 15min) |
| `/api/activities` | ‚úÖ | ActivityService + ActivityAnalyticsService with CRUD operations, 4 routes migrated (list/create, detail/update/delete, stats, time-entries), rate limiting (300 GET, 100 POST/PUT, 50 DELETE per 15min) |
| `/api/memories` | ‚úÖ | MemoryService with comprehensive filtering (20+ filters), schema mismatch caught and fixed (5 non-existent fields removed), 507‚Üí82 lines (84% reduction), rate limiting (300 GET, 100 POST per 15min) |
| `/api/memories/[id]` | ‚úÖ | Leverages MemoryService for CRUD operations (GET, PUT, DELETE), soft delete to 'archived' status, 430‚Üí107 lines (75% reduction), rate limiting (300 GET, 100 PUT, 50 DELETE per 15min) |
| `/api/tasks/[id]` | ‚úÖ | Leverages TaskService for CRUD operations (GET, PUT, DELETE), 491‚Üí110 lines (78% reduction), rate limiting (300 GET, 100 PUT, 50 DELETE per 15min) |
| `/api/ai-tasks/[id]` | ‚úÖ | Leverages AITaskService for CRUD operations (GET, PUT, DELETE), 144‚Üí112 lines (22% reduction), rate limiting (300 GET, 100 PUT, 50 DELETE per 15min) |

Highlights:
- All migrated routes now rely on the standard middleware pipeline (auth, validation, CORS, rate limiting, error handling).
- AI task migration established the repository/service pattern including cost analytics, batching, and metadata normalisation.
- Categories migration demonstrates clean CRUD pattern with usage validation (prevents deletion of in-use categories).
- Task Relations migration shows complex validation logic (task existence checks, duplicate prevention) cleanly separated into service layer.
- Conversations migration shows multi-route refactor (5 route files ‚Üí repository + service pattern), comprehensive session + message management with search and stats.
- Activities migration demonstrates Phase 3 readiness (4 route files, 950 lines ‚Üí service + analytics pattern), complex time-entry operations with timer logic, leverages existing ActivityRepository.
- Memories migration reinforces schema verification lesson (5 non-existent fields discovered), achieved 84% code reduction (507‚Üí82 lines), comprehensive filtering with 20+ parameters.
- Sub-route pattern established: `/api/memories/[id]`, `/api/tasks/[id]`, and `/api/ai-tasks/[id]` achieve 22-78% reduction by leveraging existing services, averaging 0.5h per route.
- Lookup endpoints (vendors, interaction-types, energy-days) demonstrate service-only pattern (no repository needed for read-mostly system data).
- Types were modularised into `/lib/database/types/**` and `/lib/services/types/**`, keeping legacy imports working via index re-exports.

## üöß Active & Upcoming Targets

| API Route | Current Blockers / Notes | Planned Actions |
|-----------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| `/api/tasks` | 611 lines - **Infrastructure built, migration deferred** | TaskService + TaskRepository fixes completed; see notes below |
| `/api/subtasks` | 368 lines, medium complexity | Can leverage TaskService, good next target |
| `/api/activities/[id]` | ~150 lines estimated | Simple sub-route, can leverage ActivityService, quick win |
| `/api/tasks/stats` | ~200 lines estimated | Can leverage TaskService for statistics |
| `/api/core-principles` | 1,785 lines (4 routes), complex | Extract to service layer, may need custom repository methods |
| `/api/daily-strategy` | 424 lines, complex operations | Plan incremental migration approach |

For detailed sequencing see `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` (Phase 2 & 3 sections).

## üß≠ TODO Checklist (Next Sessions)

### High Priority
- [x] `/api/categories`: stand up repository/service + middleware, capture deltas in `MIGRATION_COMPARISON.md`.
- [x] `/api/task-relations`: migrate and document relationship-specific lessons learned.
- [x] Update this dashboard after each route to keep status current.

### Medium Priority
- [x] `/api/conversations`: CRUD migration with multi-route refactor (5 routes).
- [x] `/api/activities`: CRUD + analytics migration (4 routes, first Phase 3 route).
- [x] Batch-migrate lightweight lookup endpoints (`/api/vendors`, `/api/interaction-types`, `/api/energy-days`).
- [ ] `/api/core-principles`: Extract complex business logic to service layer (1,785 lines across 4 routes - very large).
- [ ] Capture a reusable smoke-test checklist in this file once Phase 2 routes land.

### Long-Term (Phase 3 Prep)
- [x] `/api/tasks`: Infrastructure work completed (TaskService, TaskRepository fixes). Migration deferred - see notes.
- [ ] Audit repository readiness for memories; fill gaps before starting Phase 3.
- [ ] Establish automated regression baselines (snapshot or contract tests) ahead of large migrations.

## üìù Tasks Route - Infrastructure Work & Lessons Learned

### Work Completed (2025-10-03)
**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ Created `lib/services/task-service.ts` (272 lines) - CRUD operations service
- ‚úÖ Fixed `lib/database/repositories/task-repository.ts` - Updated `applyTaskFilters` to use flat column queries instead of JSON paths
- ‚úÖ Added `categoryRepository` to `ServiceDependencies` type
- ‚úÖ Updated service exports in `lib/services/index.ts`

**Infrastructure Benefits:**
- TaskService provides clean CRUD interface with category lookup
- TaskRepository now correctly queries flat database schema (not JSON content)
- Service layer ready for future use (workflows, batch operations, etc.)
- All filtering works: root_tasks_only, status, priority, hierarchy, search, pagination, sorting

### Key Discoveries
1. **Schema Mismatch**: The `Task` TypeScript interface defines a nested `content` object, but the actual database has flat columns (title, status, priority, etc.)
2. **Repository Pattern**: TaskRepository was incorrectly using JSON path queries (`content->>field`) instead of flat column names
3. **Service vs Route**: Original route works perfectly with direct Supabase queries; service layer adds complexity without clear benefit for this route
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive manual testing (40+ test cases) all passed with original route implementation

### Decision: Migration Deferred
**Reason**: Original route (611 lines) is working perfectly with all features:
- ‚úÖ All filtering works (root_tasks_only, status, priority, search, hierarchy, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Sorting and pagination work correctly
- ‚úÖ Category lookup functional
- ‚úÖ Subtasks and hierarchy fully supported
- ‚úÖ Performance is good
- ‚úÖ Zero bugs reported

**Risk/Benefit Analysis**:
- **Migration Benefits**: Slightly cleaner code (611 ‚Üí ~270 lines), automatic middleware
- **Migration Risks**: Type mismatches, complex hierarchy logic, potential regressions
- **Conclusion**: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" - defer migration until clear business need

### Recommendations for Future Migrations
1. **Verify schema first**: Check actual database columns vs TypeScript types before building repository
2. **Start simple**: Migrate simpler routes first to establish patterns
3. **Test infrastructure**: Ensure repository/service work independently before route migration
4. **Keep working code**: Don't migrate for the sake of migrating; focus on routes that need changes

### Artifacts Preserved
- Backup: `app/api/tasks/route.ts.backup` (original working version)
- Current: `app/api/tasks/route.ts` (restored original after testing)
- Service: `lib/services/task-service.ts` (ready for future use)
- Repository: `lib/database/repositories/task-repository.ts` (fixed, ready for future use)
